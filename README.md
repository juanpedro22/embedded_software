# Embedded Software (C) with WEMOS D1 R32 - Peripheral control by a web browser
This project involves the development of an embedded system based on the ESP32, designed to monitor, control, and log events through a responsive web interface. The system integrates multiple hardware interfaces, including PWM-controlled LEDs, a signaling buzzer, a servo motor, a DC motor with digital control, an alarm button with event counting, a potentiometer for brightness adjustment, and an I2C LCD display for real-time status messages. The Home.html, Settings.html, and History.html pages allow users to view device statuses, adjust configurations, and review records stored in the internal memory (LittleFS). Additionally, the system synchronizes date and time via NTP and maintains a persistent log of operations. While it was designed to support email alerts, this feature was not included due to memory constraints of the microcontroller.
